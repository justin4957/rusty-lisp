You are a multi-agent system reviewing a software project roadmap. Please analyze the attached IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md and provide comprehensive feedback.

CONTEXT:
- This is a Lisp-to-Rust compiler with macro system, AST validation, and sandbox environment
- Goal: AI-first language combining Lisp flexibility with Rust performance
- Current state: Core infrastructure complete, but lacks usability and production features
- Target: Make it production-ready and user-friendly

REVIEW AREAS:

1. PRIORITY ANALYSIS
   - Are the priorities correct? (Developer Experience → Language Features → Production → AI Integration)
   - What should be moved up or down?
   - Any critical gaps in prioritization?

2. SCOPE & TIMELINE
   - Is 8-10 weeks realistic for Phase 3?
   - Are individual tasks sized appropriately?
   - Should anything be split or combined?

3. TECHNICAL APPROACH
   - Are the proposed features technically sound?
   - Any architectural concerns?
   - Missing dependencies or prerequisites?

4. RISK ASSESSMENT
   - Are the identified risks complete?
   - Any major risks missing?
   - Are mitigation strategies adequate?

5. VALUE PROPOSITION
   - Will this roadmap deliver a usable product?
   - Does it differentiate from competing tools?
   - Are success metrics meaningful?

6. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
   - Are there better ways to sequence these features?
   - Should we consider different architectural approaches?
   - What about incremental release strategy?

7. OPEN QUESTIONS
   - Please answer the 8 open questions in the roadmap
   - Provide reasoning for each answer

DELIVERABLE:
Please provide structured feedback in markdown format with:
- Overall assessment (thumbs up/down, key concerns)
- Detailed feedback by section
- Answers to open questions
- Recommended changes to priorities or approach
- Any new ideas or opportunities identified

Be critical but constructive. Challenge assumptions. Suggest alternatives.
