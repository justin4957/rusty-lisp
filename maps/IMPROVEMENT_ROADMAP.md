## Critical Gaps & Opportunities

### 1. **Usability & Developer Experience (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: The compiler is powerful but not user-friendly for day-to-day development.

**Gaps**:
- No REPL for interactive development
- No error recovery (fails on first error)
- No helpful error messages with suggestions
- No standard library of common functions
- No package manager or module system
- No IDE/editor integration (LSP)

**Impact**: Limits adoption and makes development frustrating.

### 2. **Production Readiness (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: The compiler is a research project, not a production tool.

**Gaps**:
- No optimization passes (constant folding, dead code elimination)
- No debugging support (source maps, stack traces)
- No performance benchmarking or profiling tools
- No deployment/distribution story
- No versioning or compatibility guarantees

**Impact**: Cannot be used for real applications.

### 3. **Language Completeness (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: Core language features are missing for practical programming.

**Gaps**:
- No functions/closures (only macros)
- No data structures (vectors, maps, sets)
- No I/O operations (file, network)
- No error handling (`Result`, `Option`)
- No string manipulation
- No standard library

**Impact**: Cannot write real programs beyond toy examples.

### 4. **AI Integration (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: AI features are partially implemented but not integrated or usable.

**Gaps**:
- Sandbox mode is implemented but not used anywhere
- No agent-first APIs or examples
- No code generation templates or patterns
- No feedback loops for AI code refinement
- Actor model (#19, #20) not yet implemented

**Impact**: The "AI-first" vision is not realized.

### 5. **Documentation & Examples (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem**: Limited documentation makes the project inaccessible.

**Gaps**:
- No tutorial or getting-started guide
- No example projects or use cases
- No API documentation
- No architecture diagrams
- No contribution guide

**Impact**: Difficult for new users or contributors to understand the project.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Trying to do too much too fast
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, MVP mindset, time-boxing

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: REPL or compiler becomes too slow
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking, profiling early

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - **Risk**: New features break existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, semantic versioning

### Adoption Risks

1. **Documentation Debt**
   - **Risk**: Features built faster than documentation
   - **Mitigation**: Documentation-first approach, examples for every feature

2. **Community Engagement**
   - **Risk**: No users or contributors
   - **Mitigation**: Early showcasing (blog posts, demos), good first issues

3. **Competing Solutions**
   - **Risk**: Other Lisp/Rust projects or AI coding tools
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on unique value (AI-first, Rust integration, safety)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Approach A: Continue with Roadmap Phases 2-6 as-is
**Pros**: Completes original vision, comprehensive features
**Cons**: Takes 6+ months, no usable tool until late in process
**Decision**: ‚ùå Rejected - too slow to deliver value

### Approach B: Focus only on AI features (Phases 3 & 6)
**Pros**: Differentiates from other Lisps, aligns with vision
**Cons**: Ignores critical usability gaps, limits adoption
**Decision**: ‚ùå Rejected - puts cart before horse

### Approach C: Production-ready core, then AI features (This roadmap)
**Pros**: Usable tool in weeks, foundation for growth
**Cons**: Delays some advanced features
**Decision**: ‚úÖ **Selected** - balances speed and value

## Open Questions for Multi-Agent Review

1. **Priority Order**: Should we prioritize REPL + docs before functions/closures, or vice versa?

2. **Standard Library Scope**: How comprehensive should the initial standard library be? (Current: minimal strings, math, collections)

3. **AI Integration Timing**: Should we complete actor model (#19, #20) before or after core language features?

4. **Performance vs Features**: Should we focus on optimization early or defer until more features are complete?

5. **LSP Priority**: Is Language Server Protocol critical for Phase 3, or can it be deferred to Phase 4?

6. **Backward Compatibility**: At this stage, should we guarantee no breaking changes, or prioritize rapid iteration?

7. **Testing Strategy**: Current test coverage is good. Should we add integration tests, property-based tests, or fuzzing?

8. **Community Building**: What's the right time to publicly announce/showcase the project?

## Next Steps

1. **Get multi-agent feedback** on this roadmap (priorities, gaps, alternatives)
2. **Refine priorities** based on feedback
3. **Create GitHub issues** for Phase 3 tasks (11 new issues)
4. **Begin implementation** starting with Phase 3.1 (REPL, errors, docs)
5. **Weekly progress reviews** to ensure we stay on track

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms the Lisp compiler from a promising research project into a **practical, production-ready tool** that delivers on its AI-first vision. By focusing on usability, completeness, and tooling, we create a foundation for long-term adoption and community growth.

The key insight: **A powerful but unusable tool is worth less than a simple but usable tool.** Phase 3 prioritizes making the compiler usable, then adds power on top of that foundation.
