## Risk Management

### Critical Risks & Mitigation

1. **REPL Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Environment management harder than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Start with MVP (0.5 weeks), iterate
   - **Fallback**: Ship basic REPL, improve later

2. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Adding too many features
   - **Mitigation**: Strict time-boxing, MVP mindset
   - **Fallback**: Defer features to Phase 4

3. **Community Response**
   - **Risk**: Soft launch gets no feedback
   - **Mitigation**: Reach out directly to 20 people
   - **Fallback**: Iterate based on internal testing

4. **Actor Model Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Tokio integration takes longer
   - **Mitigation**: MVP implementation, defer advanced features
   - **Fallback**: Basic actors without async/await

5. **Burnout**
   - **Risk**: 10 weeks of intense solo work
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Break into small milestones
     - Celebrate weekly wins
     - Involve community early (alpha testers)
     - Take breaks, sustainable pace
