## ‚úÖ Week 0 Checklist

- [ ] Read REFINED_ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Read PHASE3_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Run tests (all passing)
- [ ] Create feature branch: `week0-foundation`
- [ ] Complete Issue #34 (Environment design)
- [ ] Complete Issue #35 (Release strategy)
- [ ] Complete Issue #36 (Community plan)
- [ ] Review completed work with team
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive messages
- [ ] Prepare for Week 1 (REPL + Functions)

## üéì Key Concepts to Understand

### Environment & Symbol Table
**Why it matters**: Foundation for REPL and functions
**What to design**:
- Variable bindings (name ‚Üí value)
- Nested scopes (lexical)
- Environment chaining
- REPL persistence

**Reference**: Issue #34

### Release Strategy
**Why it matters**: Need clear versioning and release process
**What to define**:
- Semantic versioning (0.x = alpha)
- Release checklist
- Changelog format
- Git workflow

**Reference**: Issue #35

### Community Engagement
**Why it matters**: Need users and feedback
**What to plan**:
- Soft launch (Week 3-4) - 10-20 alpha testers
- Demo launch (Week 6-7) - 100-200 stars
- Production launch (Week 10+) - 500+ stars

**Reference**: Issue #36

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Skipping Week 0
**Problem**: Jumping straight to coding without design
**Impact**: Rework later, architectural issues
**Solution**: Complete all Week 0 issues first

### 2. Over-Engineering
**Problem**: Designing for future features not in Phase 3
**Impact**: Delayed delivery, unnecessary complexity
**Solution**: MVP mindset, design for current needs

### 3. Scope Creep
**Problem**: Adding features not in roadmap
**Impact**: Timeline slip, burnout
**Solution**: Strict adherence to refined roadmap

### 4. No Community Engagement
**Problem**: Building in isolation
**Impact**: No feedback, no adoption
**Solution**: Phased launches (soft ‚Üí demo ‚Üí production)

## üÜò Getting Help

### If Stuck on Design
- Review MULTI_AGENT_FEEDBACK.md (engineering perspective)
- Look at similar projects (Clojure, Racket, Chez Scheme)
- Ask specific questions in GitHub discussions

### If Timeline Slipping
- Review REFINED_ROADMAP.md risk mitigation
- Consider deferring non-critical features
- Adjust scope but not quality

### If Need Clarification
- Check issue description and acceptance criteria
- Review related documents
- Create GitHub discussion for questions

## üìà Success Metrics

### Week 0 Success Criteria
- [ ] Environment design document complete
- [ ] Release strategy document complete
- [ ] Community plan document complete
- [ ] All design documents reviewed
- [ ] Team alignment on approach
- [ ] Ready to start Week 1 coding

## üéâ Celebrate Wins

**Week 0 is complete when**:
- All design documents created
- Team aligned on approach
- No major architectural concerns
- Excited to start coding Week 1!

## üìû Communication

### Daily Updates
- Post progress in GitHub discussions
- Update issue status (in progress ‚Üí done)
- Commit regularly with descriptive messages

### Weekly Reviews
- Review completed issues
- Assess progress vs timeline
- Adjust next week's plan if needed

## üöÄ After Week 0

**Next**: Week 1-2 (REPL + Functions)
**Issues**: #37-#40
**Key Work**:
- Implement basic REPL
- Add readline support
- Implement function definitions
- Add lexical scoping

**Preparation**:
- Review Rust `rustyline` crate
- Review environment design
- Study function compilation strategies

## üìù Notes

### Test-Driven Development
Always write tests first, then implement functionality. See CLAUDE.md for TDD guidelines.

### Incremental Commits
Make small, focused commits. Each commit should be a complete piece of functionality.

### Documentation
Update README.md and docs/ as you go, not at the end.

## üéØ Ready to Begin?

**Your Next Action**:
1. Open `REFINED_ROADMAP.md`
2. Read Week 0 section carefully
3. Start Issue #34 (Environment design)

**Remember**: Week 0 is about designing, not coding. Take time to think through the architecture carefully.

**Good luck, and let's build something amazing!** üöÄ
